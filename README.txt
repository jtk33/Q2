WELCOME TO THE APERTURE SCIENCE QUAKE INITIATIVE
with help from Black Mesa

In this modification for Quake 2, you'll find:
A functional portal gun
A semi-functional gravity gun
And you'll notice that the BFG has been replaced by a weapon more similar to a Combine one.

"What's changed with me?" You may ask
You have been outfitted with long fall boots, as well as a jetpack, in order to protect yourself from those baddies. You also may find HEV suit armor, which is intended to increase your speed, but it may not do so.

"Is this safe?" You may ask, to which we respond with "Probably"

Happy testing!
